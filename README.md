# Integrating Affinidi Authentication into an E-commerce React Application

This document provides instructions for integrating the Affinidi passwordless login solution into a React application.

Affinidi offers secure, privacy-preserving credential sharing powered by blockchain technology. By integrating their login component, you can enable passwordless authentication for users.

## API Reference

#### The authentication completion route handles the response after a successful login with Affinidi. It accepts a POST request at /api/affinidi-auth/complete with the authorization code and state.

```http
  POST /api/affinidi-auth/complete
```

## Benefits:

- Passwordless login experience
- Built-in security and privacy controls
- No password or sensitive data stored

## Prerequisites
Before integrating Affinidi Login, you will need:

- Affinidi Vault Browser Extension installed
- Affinidi CLI tools installed
- A React application generated with Create React App

## Introduction

### How Affinidi Vault Works
Use Affinidi Vault to discover, collect, store, share, and monetise your data across different applications while controlling your data. Applications that wish to request data from you must get the userâ€™s consent before being able to extract the data from the Vault through Verifiable Presentation (VP).

## Presentation Exchange (PEX) Query
The Presentation Exchange protocol implemented by Affinidi Vault enables data interoperability and uses PEX query to request user data. Applications can assess the trustworthiness of the data by describing the required data that the user must satisfy using the presentation definition.

See the sample PEX query that requests the email address of the user from the Vault:
```
{
  "id": "email_vc_data",
  "name": "Email VC data",
  "purpose": "Check if data contains necessary fields",
  "constraints": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "path": [
          "$.credentialSubject.email"
        ],
        "purpose": "Email address",
        "filter": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
} 
```
The above definition is part of the default presentation definition of Affinidi Login to authenticate users using their verified email address as their identity.

## Enable Affinidi Login

Once we confirm that the generated application is working, we will enable the Affinidi Login through the affinidi-react-auth  library.

1. Install the affinidi-react-auth library from NPM.
```
npm install @affinidi/affinidi-react-auth
```

2. To proxy unknown requests to your API server during development, add a proxy field to your package.json like this:
```
 "proxy": "http://localhost:3001"
```

After installing the library and configuring the package.json, we modify the src/App.js file and paste the following codes to enable Affinidi Login component.

3. Import the env variable and libraries required.
```
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import React from "react"

import { AffinidiLoginButton, useAffinidiProfile } from '@affinidi/affinidi-react-auth'

const apiBaseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_URI || '';
```

4. Retrieve the user information after successful authentication using useAffinidiProfile hook and add the logout function.
```
const { isLoading, error, profile, handleLogout } = useAffinidiProfile({
     authCompleteUrl: `${apiBaseUrl}/api/affinidi-auth/complete`
  })

async function logout() {
    //clear session cookie
    handleLogout();
    window.location.href = "/";
}
```

5. Display the Affinidi Login button, loading indicator, user profile, and error messages using the below code.
```
{!profile && <>
    <AffinidiLoginButton authInitUrl={`${apiBaseUrl}/api/affinidi-auth/init`} />
</>}

{isLoading && <p>Loading...</p>}

{profile && <>
    <button style={{ marginRight: 10 }} onClick={logout}>
    Logout
    </button>

    <h3>User Profile</h3>
    <pre style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>{JSON.stringify(profile, null, 4)}</pre>
</>}

{error && <><h2>error</h2>{error}</>}
```
After implementing the required codes, restart the application. The Affinidi Login button shows on the homepage.

In cases where proxy settings is not working on the app with your hosting provider, define the REACT_APP_SERVER_URI in the .env with the base url of your Express server.
